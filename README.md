# PedestrianQuantumSimulation

## I. Introduction

PedestrianQuantumSimulation is a quantum-inspired pedestrian mobility modeling framework designed to simulate spatial movement under uncertainty. 

The model represents pedestrian dynamics as a probability distribution derived from an urban potential field:

V_total = V_urbs + V_civitas

where:

- V_urbs represents built-environment influences (urban form, density, centrality, constraints)
- V_civitas represents social and pedestrian interaction effects

The framework supports:

1) A quantum-inspired Schrödinger-based probabilistic solver  
2) A classical Boltzmann-based baseline model  

The output is a spatial probability map representing pedestrian distribution patterns.

## II. Data Requirements

The model requires raster-based GIS inputs (GeoTIFF format) with identical spatial resolution and extent.

Typical input layers include:

- building_density.tif
- street_centrality.tif
- building_height.tif
- tree_height.tif
- pedestrian_density.tif
- poi_density.tif
- wall_constraint.tif
- mean_depth.tif
- isovist.tif
- vehicle_density.tif
- pedestrian_accessibility.tif

Optional validation datasets:

- observed_pedestrian_morning.tif
- observed_pedestrian_afternoon.tif
- observed_pedestrian_evening.tif

Outputs generated by the model:

- V_total_*.tif
- pedestrian_probability_*.tif
- Visualization PNG files
- Optional animation outputs

## IV. Methodological Basis

The framework integrates:

- Potential field theory
- Probabilistic spatial modeling
- Schrödinger-type quantum-inspired formulations
- Classical statistical mechanics baseline (Boltzmann distribution)
- Raster-based GIS computation

The system allows switching between quantum-inspired and classical computation modes for comparative analysis.
